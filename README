# about

A simple script to control Google Pacman with Watir. For now Pacman just
randomly goes in all directions. Script ends after game over.

# prerequisites

Ruby (http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and Watir (http://watir.com/).

# environment

Tested only on:
- Windows 2003
  - Internet Explorer 6
  - Internet Explorer 7
- Windows XP
  - Internet Explorer 8

It should work on other versions of Windows and Internet Explorer. If it does
not work, maybe changing `7` in `7.times {tab(b)}` to a higher or lower number
could help.

# installation

Tested only on Windows XP Professional, Version 2002, Service Pack 3, fully
patched.

## install Ruby

- log in as administrator (Ruby and Watir will probably not install correctly
  otherwise)

- leave all defaults except at `Installation Destination and Optional Tasks`
  step check `Add Ruby executables to your PATH` and `Associate .rb and .rbw
  files with this Ruby installation`
