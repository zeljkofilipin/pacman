# About

A simple script to control Google Pacman with Watir.

# Prerequisites

You have to have Ruby (http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and Watir
(http://watir.com/) installed.

# Run

Just run pacman.rb

# Environment

Tested only on Windows 2003 and Internet Explorer 6 and 7. It should work on other
versions of Windows and Internet Explorer. If it does not work, maybe changing `7` in
`7.times {tab(b)}` to a higher or lower number could help.
